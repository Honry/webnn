Introduction {#intro}
=====================

We're working on this section. Meanwhile, please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/blob/master/explainer.md">explainer</a>.

Use cases {#usecases}
=====================

## Application Use Cases ## {#usecases-application}

This section illustrates application-level use cases for neural network
inference hardware acceleration. All applications in those use cases can be
built on top of pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) [[models]].

### Person Detection ### {#usecase-person-detection}

A user opens a web-based video conferencing application, but she temporarily
leaves from her room. The application is watching whether she is in front of her
PC by using object detection (for example, using object detection approaches
such as [[SSD]] or [[YOLO]] that use a single DNN) to detect regions in a camera
input frame that include persons.

When she comes back, the application automatically detects her and notifies
other online users that she is active now.

### Semantic Segmentation ### {#usecase-segmentation}

A user joins a teleconference via a web-based video conferencing application at
her desk since no meeting room in her office is available. During the
teleconference, she does not wish that her room and people in the background are
visible. To protect the privacy of the other people and the surroundings, the
application runs a machine learning model such as [[DeepLabv3+]] or
[[MaskR-CNN]] to semantically split an image into segments and replaces
segments that represent other people and background with another picture.

### Skeleton Detection ### {#usecase-skeleton-detection}

A web-based video conferencing application tracks a pose of user's skeleton by
running a machine learning model, which allows for real-time human pose
estimation, such as [[PoseNet]] to recognize her gesture and body language. When
she raises her hand, her microphone is automatically unmuted and she can start
speaking on the teleconference.

### Face Recognition ### {#usecase-face-recognition}

There are multiple people in the conference room and they join an online meeting
using a web-based video conferencing application. The application detects faces
of participants by using object detection (for example, using object detection
approaches such as [[SSD]]) and checks whether each face was present at the
previous meeting or not by running a machine learning model such as [[FaceNet]],
which verifies whether two faces would be identical or not.

### Facial Landmark Detection ### {#usecase-facial-landmarks}

A user wants to find new glasses that beautifully fits her on an online glasses
store. The online store offers web-based try-on simulator that runs a machine
learning model such as Face Alignment Network [[FAN]] to detect facial landmarks
like eyes, nose, mouth, etc. When she chooses a pair of glasses, the simulator
properly renders the selected glasses on the detected position of eyes on her
facial image.

### Style Transfer ### {#usecase-style-transfer}

A user is looking for cosmetics on an online store and wondering which color may
fit her face. The online store shows sample facial makeup images of cosmetics,
and offers makeup simulator that runs a machine learning model like
[[ContextualLoss]] or [[PairedCycleGAN]] to transfer the makeup style of the
sample makeup image to her facial image. She can check how the selected makeup
looks like on her face by the simulator.

### Super Resolution ### {#usecase-super-resolution}

A web-based video conferencing is receiving a video stream from its peer, but
the resolution of the video becomes lower due to network congestion. To prevent
degradation of the perceived video quality, the application runs a machine
learning model for super-resolution such as [[SRGAN]] to generate
higher-resolution video frames.

### Image Captioning ### {#usecase-image-captioning}

For better accessibility, a web-based presentation application provides
automatic image captioning by running a machine learning model such as
[[im2txt]] which predicts explanatory words of the presentation slides.

### Machine Translation ### {#usecase-translation}

Multiple people from various countries are talking via a web-based real-time
text chat application. The application translates their conversation by using a
machine learning model such as [[GNMT]] or [[OpenNMT]], which translates every
text into different language.

### Emotion Analysis ### {#usecase-emotion-analysis}

A user is talking to her friend via a web-based real-time text chat application,
and she is wondering how the friend feels because she cannot see the friend's
face. The application analyses the friend's emotion by using a machine learning
model such as [[DeepMoji]], which infers emotion from input texts, and displays
an emoji that represents the estimated emotion.

### Video Summarization ### {#usecase-video-summalization}

A web-based video conferencing application records received video streams, and
it needs to reduce recorded video data to be stored. The application generates
the short version of the recorded video by using a machine learning model for
video summarization such as [[Video-Summarization-with-LSTM]].

### Noise Suppression ### {#usecase-noise-suppression}

A web-based video conferencing application records received audio streams, but 
usually the background noise is everywhere. The application leverages real-time 
noise suppression using Recurrent Neural Network such as [[RNNoise]] for 
suppressing background dynamic noise like baby cry or dog barking to improve 
audio experiences in video conferences.

## Framework Use Cases ## {#usecases-framework}

This section collects framework-level use cases for a dedicated low-level API
for neural network inference hardware acceleration. It is expected that Machine
Learning frameworks will be key consumers of the Web Neural Network API (WebNN
API) and the low-level details exposed through the WebNN API are abstracted out
from typical web developers. However, it is also expected that web developers
with specific interest and competence in Machine Learning will want to interface
with the WebNN API directly instead of a higher-level ML framework.

### Custom Layer ### {#usecase-custom-layer}

A web application developer wants to run a DNN model on the WebNN API. However,
she has found that some of activation functions like [[LeakyReLU]], [[ELU]],
etc. are not included in the WebNN API. To address this issue, she constructs
custom layers of the additional activation functions on top of the WebNN API.
Note that the scope of custom layers may include convolution, normalization,
etc. as well as activation.

### Network Concatenation ### {#usecase-network-concat}

A web application uses a DNN model, and its model data of upper convolutional
layers and lower fully-connected layers are stored in separate files, since
model data of the fully-connected layers are periodically updated due to fine
tuning at the server side.

Therefore, the application downloads both partial model files at first and
concatenates them into a single model. When the model is updated, the
application downloads fine-tuned part of the model and replace only the
fully-connected layers with it.

### Performance Adaptation ### {#usecase-perf-adapt}

A web application developer has a concern about performance of her DNN model on
mobile devices. She has confirmed that it may run too slow on mobile devices
which do not have GPU acceleration. To address this issue, her web application
refers to the WebNN API to confirm whether acceleration is available or not, so
that the application can display the warning for devices without acceleration.

After several weeks, she has developed a tiny DNN model that can even run on
CPU. In order to accommodate CPU execution, she modifies the application
so that the application loads the tiny model in the case of CPU-only devices.

};
</script>

### batchNormalization ### {#api-modelbuilder-batchnorm}
Normalize the tensor values of input features across the batch dimension using [[Batch-Normalization]]. For each input feature, the mean and variance values of that feature are computed across the batch dimension during training.
<script type=idl>
dictionary BatchNormalizationOptions {
  Operand scale;
  Operand bias;
  long axis = 1;
  float epsilon = 1e-5;
};

              - *axis*: a {{long}} scalar. The index to the feature count dimension of the input shape for which the mean and variance values are. When it's not specified, the default value is 1.
              - *epsilon*: a {{float}} scalar. A small value to prevent computational error due to divide-by-zero. The default value is 0.00001 when not specified.
        
    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The batch-normalized N-D tensor of the same shape as the input tensor.

    When *input* is a 4-D tensor of the *"nchw"* or *"nhwc"* layout, *options.axis* should be set to 1 or 3 respectively. The axis value designates the feature or channel count dimension of the input tensor.

    <div class="note">
    The behavior of this operation when the input tensor is 4-D of the *"nchw"* layout can be generically emulated from 
    the usage of other operations as follow. However, user agents typically have a more efficient implementation for it, 
    therefore its usage is encouraged from the performance standpoint.
    <pre highlight="js">
    const shape = [1,-1,1,1];
    return builder.add(
        builder.mul(
          builder.reshape(options.scale, shape),
          builder.div(
            builder.sub(input, builder.reshape(mean, shape)),
            builder.pow(
              builder.add(builder.reshape(variance, shape), builder.constant(options.epsilon)),
              builder.constant(0.5))
            )
          ),
        builder.reshape(options.bias, shape)
      );
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

### clamp ### {#api-modelbuilder-clamp}

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The output tensor of the same shape as *x*.

    Clamp the input tensor element-wise within a range specified by *minValue* and *maxValue*. The calculation follows the expression min(max(x, minValue), maxValue). When *minValue* is not specified, the clamping is not performed on the lower limit. When *maxValue* is not specified, the clamping is not performed on the upper limit.

    <div class="note">
    The behavior of this operation can be generically emulated from the usage of
    other operations as follow. However, user agents typically have a more
    efficient implementation for it, therefore its usage is encouraged from the
    performance standpoint.
    <pre highlight="js">

      if (options.maxValue === undefined) {
        return x;
      } else {
        return builder.min(x, options.maxValue);
      }
    } else {
      if (options.maxValue === undefined) {
        return builder.max(x, options.minValue);
      } else {
        return builder.min(builder.max(x, options.minValue), options.maxValue);
      }
    }
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

### concat ### {#api-modelbuilder-concat}

<script type=idl>
partial interface ModelBuilder {
  Operand concat(sequence<Operand> inputs, long axis);
};
</script>
<div algorithm=concat>
    **Arguments:**
        - *inputs*: a sequence of {{Operand}}. All input tensors must have the
            same shape, except for the size of the dimension to concatenate on.
        - *axis*: a {{long}} scalar. The axis that the inputs concatenate along, with
            the value in the interval [0, N) where N is the rank of all the
            inputs.
        
    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The concatenated tensor of all the inputs along
    the *axis*. The output tensor has the same shape except on the dimension
    that all the inputs concatenated along. The size of that dimension is
    computed as the sum of all the input sizes of the same dimension.
</div>

### conv2d ### {#api-modelbuilder-conv2d}
Compute a 2-D convolution given 4-D input and filter tensors
<script type=idl>
enum AutoPad {
  "explicit",
  "same-upper",
  "same-lower"
};

dictionary Conv2dOptions {
  sequence<long> padding;
  sequence<long> strides;
  sequence<long> dilations;
  sequence<long> outputPadding;
  sequence<long> outputSizes;
  AutoPad autoPad = "explicit";
  boolean transpose = false;
  long groups = 1;
  OperandLayout layout = "nchw";
};

partial interface ModelBuilder {
  Operand conv2d(Operand input, Operand filter, optional Conv2dOptions options = {});
};
</script>
<div algorithm=conv2d>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{Operand}}. The input 4-D tensor. The logical shape
            is interpreted according to the value of *options.layout*.
        - *filter*: an {{Operand}}. The filter 4-D tensor. The logical shape is
            interpreted according to the value of *options.layout* and *options.groups*.
        - *options*: an optional {{Conv2dOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
            - *padding*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 4. The additional rows and columns added to the beginning and ending of each spatial dimension of *input*, [beginning_height, ending_height, beginning_width, ending_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [0,0,0,0].
            - *strides*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The stride of the sliding window for each spatial dimension of *input*, [stride_height, stride_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [1,1].
            - *dilations*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The dilation factor for each spatial dimension of *input*, [dilation_height, dilation_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [1,1].
            - *outputPadding*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The padding values applied to each spatial dimension of the output tensor when *options.transpose* is set to true. This explicit padding values are needed to disambiguate the output tensor shape for transposed convolution when the value of the *options.strides* is greater than 1. Note that these values are only used to disambiguate output shape when needed; it does not necessarily cause any padding value to be written to the output tensor. If not specified, the values are assumed to be [0,0].
            - *outputSizes*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The sizes of the last two dimensions of the output tensor when *options.transpose* is set to true. When the output sizes are explicitly specified, the output padding values in *options.outputPadding* are ignored. If not specified, the output sizes are automatically computed.
            - *autoPad*: an {{AutoPad}}. The automatic input padding options. By default, this argument is set to *"explicit"*, which means that the values in the *options.padding* array should be used for input padding. When the option is set other than *"explicit"*, the values in the *options.padding* array are ignored. With the *"same-upper"* option, the padding values are automatically computed such that the additional ending padding of the spatial input dimensions would allow all of the input values in the corresponding dimension to be filtered. The *"same-lower"* option is similar but padding is applied to the beginning padding of the spatial input dimensions instead of the ending one.
            - *transpose*: a {{boolean}} indicating that a transposed convolution operation is performed. Transposed convolution is used in upsampling networks to increase the resolution of a feature as opposed to the typical convolution process that reduces the feature's resolution. When transposed convolution is performed, *options.outputPadding* may be needed to disambiguate the output tensor shape. If not present, this option is assumed to be false.
            - *groups*: a {{long}} scalar. The number of groups that input channels and output channels are divided into, default to 1.
            - *layout*: an {{OperandLayout}} with value as *"nchw"* or *"nhwc"*. The default value is *"nchw"*. This argument specifies the layout format of the input, output and filter tensor. Specifically,

                "nchw":
                    - input tensor: [batches, input_channels, height, width]
                    - filter tensor: [output_channels, input_channels/groups,
                        height, width]
                    - output tensor: [batches, output_channels, height, width]
                    
                "nhwc":
                    - input tensor: [batches, height, width, input_channels]
                    - filter tensor: [height, width, input_channels/groups,
                        output_channels]
                    - output tensor: [batches, height, width, output_channels]

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The output 4-D tensor that contains the convolution result. The output shape is interpreted according to the *options.layout* value. More specifically the sizes of the last two dimensions of the output tensor, the spatial dimensions, for the convolution operation can be calculated as follow:

    *output size = 1 + (input size - filter size + beginning padding + ending padding) / stride*

    Whereas for the transposed convolution case with *options.transpose* set to *true*, unless the *options.outputSizes* values are explicitly specified, the *options.outputPadding* may be needed to compute the spatial dimension values of the output tensor as follow:

    *output size = (input size - 1) ** *stride + filter size - beginning padding - ending padding + output padding*

    <div class="note">
    A *depthwise* conv2d operation is a variant of grouped convolution, used in models like the MobileNet, where the *options.groups* = input_channels = output_channels and the shape of filter tensor is [options.groups, 1, height, width]
    for *"nchw"* layout or [height, width, 1, options.groups] for "nhwc" layout.

### matmul ### {#api-modelbuilder-matmul}
Compute the matrix product of two input tensors.
<script type=idl>

<div algorithm=matmul>
    **Arguments:**
        - *a*: an {{Operand}}. The first input N-D tensor.
        - *b*: an {{Operand}}. The second input N-D tensor.

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The output N-D tensor that contains the matrix
    product of two input tensors.

    Compute the matrix product of two input tensors. It behaves as following:
        - If both *a* and *b* are 2-D, they are multiplied like conventional
            matrices and produce a 2-D tensor as the output.
        - If either *a* or *b* is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of
            matrices with dimensions corresponding to the last two indices. The
            matrix multiplication will be broadcasted accordingly by following
            [[!numpy-broadcasting-rule]]. The output is a N-D tensor whose rank
            is the maximum rank of the input tensors. For each dimension, except
            the last two, of the output tensor, its size is the maximum size
            along that dimension of the input tensors.
        - If *a* is 1-D, it is converted to a 2-D tensor by prepending a 1 to
            its dimensions.
        - If *b* is 1-D, it is converted to a 2-D tensor by by appending a 1 to
            its dimensions.
        - If both *a* and *b* are 1-D, the operation is a vector dot-product,
            which produces a scalar output.

        - *input*: an {{Operand}}. The input tensor.
        - *padding*: an {{Operand}}. The 2-D Tensor of integer values indicating the number of padding values to add at the beginning and end of each input dimensions. The tensor has shape [*n*, 2] where *n* is the rank of the input tensor. For each dimension *D* of *input*, *padding[D, 0]* indicates how many values to add before the content in that dimension, and *padding[D, 1]* indicates how many values to add after the content in that dimension.
        - *options*: an optional {{PadOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
            - *mode*: a {{PaddingMode}}. The different ways to pad the tensor. When not set, it's assumed to be "constant".
            - *value*: a {{float}}. The pad value when the *options.mode* is set to *"constant"*. When not set, it's assumed to be 0.

### pooling operations ### {#api-modelbuilder-pool2d}
Compute a *mean*, *L2 norm*, or *max* reduction operation across all the elements within the moving window over the input tensor. See the description of each type of reduction in [[#api-modelbuilder-reduce]].
<script type=idl>
dictionary Pool2dOptions {
  sequence<long> windowDimensions;
  sequence<long> padding;
  sequence<long> strides;
  sequence<long> dilations;
  AutoPad autoPad = "explicit";
  OperandLayout layout = "nchw";
};

partial interface ModelBuilder {
  Operand averagePool2d(Operand input, optional Pool2dOptions options = {});
  Operand l2Pool2d(Operand input, optional Pool2dOptions options = {});
  Operand maxPool2d(Operand input, optional Pool2dOptions options = {});
};
</script>
<div algorithm=pool2d>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{Operand}}. The input 4-D tensor. The logical shape
            is interpreted according to the value of *options.layout*.
        - *options*: an optional {{Pool2dOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
            - *windowDimensions*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The dimensions of the sliding window,
                [window_height, window_width]. If not present, the window dimensions are assumed to be the height  
                and width dimensions of the input shape. 
            - *padding*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 4. The additional rows and columns added to the beginning and ending of each spatial dimension of *input*, [beginning_height, ending_height, beginning_width, ending_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [0,0,0,0].

                sliding window for each spatial dimension of *input*,

            - *autoPad*: an {{AutoPad}}. The automatic input padding options. By default, this argument is set to *"explicit"*, which means that the values in the *options.padding* array should be used for input padding. When the option is set other than *"explicit"*, the values in the *options.padding* array are ignored. With the *"same-upper"* option, the padding values are automatically computed such that the additional ending padding of the spatial input dimensions would allow all of the input values in the corresponding dimension to be filtered. The *"same-lower"* option is similar but padding is applied to the beginning padding of the spatial input dimensions instead of the ending one.
            - *layout*: an {{OperandLayout}} with value as *"nchw"* or
                *"nhwc"*. The default value is *"nchw"*. This argument specifies the
                layout format of the input and output.

                "nchw":
                    - input tensor: [batches, channels, height, width]
                    - output tensor: [batches, channels, height, width]

                "nhwc":
                    - input tensor: [batches, height, width, channels]
                    - output tensor: [batches, height, width, channels]
